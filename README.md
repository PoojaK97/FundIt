**Aim**

To build a platform that democratizes access to capital for small businesses via crowdfunding.

**Inspiration**

Most startups’ founders don't have those connections or profits to get funding and especially in a year full of uncertainties many big investors are scared to invest in small businesses. And not all startups makes million dollars in their beginning years. Meanwhile, most people are not as rich but want to invest. So we want to build aplatform that benefits color businesses (because majority of them are quite small) and Investors both. Startups put their video pitches to help make investor a decision on the startup and investor can make an appointment with the business to know about theirfuture goals before investing.

**Potential users**

+ Retail investors - who will be investing in the companies that are listed on our platform
+ Startups - they sign up for crowdfunding in exchange for equity.
